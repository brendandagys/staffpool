A Web app to track Code responses

This is a tool that I built to track staff assignments during Code responses.

You can submit data and view it being populated in real-time.

There is also functionality to change the status of the event, and send messages to all on the site.

This Web application was built to allow senior staff at the North Bay Regional Health Centre to communicate during emergency procedures. Whenever there is a fire alarm, an external threat, etc., the building locks down and some staff are asked to watch doorways and entrances to ensure that there is no flow in or out of the building. Senior staff (those who assign staff to entrances, and others) can use the Website to communicate in real-time with one another, and with the Command Centre, who will also be available.

The Website has forms for staff to enter names of those assigned to areas, and a Status page, that updates instantly whenever a new name is entered. The Website also has a custom-built instant-messaging system, for staff to type messages to one another.

Last, a general Status can be set, such as ‘Full Evacuation.’ Upon triggering this, every user on the Website will receive an alert and flashing banner that indicates this change.
